# Dota2_minigame

This project has 2 parts:

1 - Web scrapping hero attributes and information (matchups, counters) from dotapedia.com. This data will be used in the mini game as factors to select heroes draft

2 - Minigame. Drafting and macro strategy aspect of the Dota2 game. 

This minigame is created by Quoc-Anh Duong and inpired by the game of Dota2. To run this minigame, download the repository and run the Dota2_run_game.ipynb file. 

If you're familiar with Dota2, select the hero as in captain mode. Select a few more strategic decisions throughout the game and the result will be shown when running the notebook. 

Future development is creating an AI that will play the drafting phase and strategy agains the user. 

Have fun!
